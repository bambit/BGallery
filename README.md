My repository of the Gallery Server Pro (http://www.galleryserverpro.com/)

You can see the installation guide here:

Please note, the original author asks that a license key be used, and not to modify the code in such a way do disable to divert this requirement.  Doing so will surely affect your karma and may result in a thousand fleas infesting your body.  

You can get a license, including a free one, here: http://www.galleryserverpro.com/buy 


Background
==========
Roger Martin built the original Gallery Server Pro.  I tried it out and liked the general flow of it, but it didn't do quite enough for me, so I wanted to enhance it.  Luckily, Robert has released this under the GPL v3, so I'm able to do just that.

Some of my goals for this are:
1) Integration with Google maps for imaages
2) Faster rendering times for pages.  Locally, on a decent box, the site tends to run somewhat slower than I would expect
3) Search by meta information
4) Multi media editing (tags, people, etc)
5) Complete test suite written
